                    “Jacobson Staffing is focused on relationship, possesses a tremendous resource network and demonstrated ability able to match talent and opportunity.”I would strongly recommend Terri and Jacobson Staffing to anyone needing to add top talent to their teams.

                     “Jacobson Staffing is focused on relationship, possesses a tremendous resource network and demonstrated ability able to match talent and opportunity.”Terri takes the time to not only understand the requirements of the position, but also the culture, leadership style, and all expectations. Candidates are properly screened for the best possible fit, significantly reducing the time required for me to review and select a candidate. For the chosen candidate, their success on the job always exceeds my expectations. If you are not already using Terri and Jacobson Staffing, I would recommend that you do.”

                    “Jacobson Staffing is focused on relationship, possesses a tremendous resource network and demonstrated ability able to match talent and opportunity.”I am a big fan of Jacobson Staffing. My association with Terri and her team dates back almost 10 years; they are my preferred choice for quality candidates. Jacobson stands out from their competitors in the way they vet candidates … this is key for me in evaluating staffing agencies. In addition, the candidates are top notch. Two hires in the past six months that came through Jacobson Staffing reflect their diligence in understanding my organization, the required hard skills, and most important the soft skills that fit our culture. Two thumbs up to Terri and her staff!!”

                    “Jacobson Staffing is focused on relationship, possesses a tremendous resource network and demonstrated ability able to match talent and opportunity.”Terri and Jacobson Staffing deliver results, and are a joy to work with. I am extremely pleased to have had the opportunity to work with them. They were able to show me and my referrals career opportunities that they were representing exclusively and semi-exclusively – some of these positions were not even on the job boards.
Not only have they placed me, they have successfully placed three of my referrals, Importantly, their name carries respect among hiring managers. I have recommended them to hiring managers, as well, with full confidence that the candidates represented are of the highest caliber.
Their reputation integrity shines through in every step. Everyone whom has worked with them reports high marks in all areas. I eagerly recommend Jacobson Staffing every time, all the time, and so do all who have worked with them.”

                    “Jacobson Staffing is focused on relationship, possesses a tremendous resource network and demonstrated ability able to match talent and opportunity.”Having been both a consultant for Jacobson Staffing as well as a customer trying to find quality talent for our positions, I have seen the strengths of the firm from both angles. Terri has created a culture with her team where a personal touch is expected when working with every potential or existing candidate as well as customer. This is evident in every interaction with the team. Rarely do you see a firm this committed to not only finding the right fit for the client’s opening, but also a commitment to the candidate to make sure they are well informed and making the best decision for their career at a personal level. As a result, Jacobson Staffing is the first place I call for my recruiting needs.”
